# Interactive Map: Top Attractions in Montreal

Using R Markdown and Leaflet, an interactive map was created with top tourist attractions in Montreal, Canada.

Custom markers were added on the map, based on the latitude and longitude of each place. 

Representative pictures which describe the specific tourist attractions were used for icons.

Further details about places of interest can be found through the links associated with each popup icon.

**The .Rmd, .html and icons files are uploaded in the repository.
The generated map is available at http://rpubs.com/lilianabraescu/458088**
